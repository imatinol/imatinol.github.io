		<h1 id="aboutme">ABOUT ME</h1>

		<div class="line-break"></div>

		<p>I am a 26-year old fresh graduate from Oulu, Finland. I studied information processing science at the University of Oulu. I had my master’s degree finished on 19.12.2016. I am currently looking to start a new job and I am ready to face new challenges.<br><br>
		I have gathered experience from software testing. I started my IT career as a summer trainee in a software testing team. The team ran automated stability software tests for WCDMA BTS products. Later I started working in the same team as a thesis worker. My task was to design and implement a database for the team’s internal use. I also worked as a software tester in the same team at the same time. So, at the same team I gathered experience from software testing, test planning, test automation, database development, telecommunications equipment (WCDMA BTSs), project work etc. My university studies consisted of software engineering and information systems related courses. It could be said that I have gathered broad experience from different kind of software engineering work in school and in working life.<br><br>
		I am looking to face new challenges in software engineering related area of work. Right now I am most interested in a job where I can challenge myself. At the moment I am highly interested in web development which is why I started working on this website. It would be ideal if I had a job where I could use my current skills and enhance those and other skills to next level at the same time. However, I am not afraid of any software engineering related tasks – I am always willing to learn more and challenge myself.<br><br>
		I am a social, self-imposed and cooperative employee. I have worked with a variety of people from different cultures of all ages in my previous jobs and school. I can communicate in English and Finnish – written and spoken.<br><br>
		You can contact me any time and I will be happy to tell you more about myself.<br><br>
		Best regards,<br>
		Ilari Matinolli</p>
